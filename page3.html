    <p>
      Eye health is crucial for overall well-being. Regular eye examinations are essential to detect and address vision issues, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Additionally, maintaining a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals, protecting the eyes from harmful UV rays with sunglasses, and practicing good eye hygiene contribute to long-term eye health. Remember to take breaks during extended screen time, stay hydrated, and promptly address any discomfort or changes in vision with professional guidance. Prioritizing eye health promotes clear vision and helps prevent potential eye conditions.    </p>

      <h2>Contact Lenses</h2>
<p>
  Contact lenses are a popular alternative to traditional eyeglasses, offering a discreet and flexible way to correct vision. They come in various types, catering to different vision needs and preferences:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Wear Lenses:</strong> Designed for daily use and removed before sleep. They are convenient and require minimal maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Extended Wear Lenses:</strong> Can be worn continuously, including during sleep, for an extended period. Consultation with an eye care professional is essential for proper usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Toric Lenses:</strong> Specifically crafted to correct astigmatism, providing clear and sharp vision for individuals with this refractive error.</li>
    <li><strong>Colored or Cosmetic Lenses:</strong> Offer an opportunity to change or enhance eye color for aesthetic purposes. Available with or without prescription.</li>
  </ul>
  Using contact lenses requires adherence to hygiene practices, including regular cleaning, proper storage, and scheduled replacement. Individuals with specific eye conditions or lifestyle preferences may find contact lenses to be a comfortable and effective vision correction option.
